# Project overview

This is intended to ge a small code repository to supplement this paprer "insert link here"

There is a collection of examples that will demonstrate the algorithms described in the paper that can be used for all of the scripts.

## Included files

Full Run.ipynb - This Jupyter notebook will do all the steps described in the paper on a given data set

LSA2RAdial.ipynb -

Radial2Radial.ipynb - 

TrasnportationHelper.py - this python script contains all the helper functions that that the algorithms rely on. It is shared across all the scripts to reduce how big all the Jupyter Notebooks are.


## Technical requirements
This project relies on the gurobi LP solver, and prototyping is done using Jupyter notebooks.

gurobi installation instructions can be found here:
