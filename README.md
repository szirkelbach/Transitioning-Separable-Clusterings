# Project overview

Currently the work done for the paper can be found in the file automated-radial-non-Trivial.ipynb

There is archived work in the folder that is being turned into a python library that can be of some use, but the code is less clean and repetitave.


This project is focused on visualizing the transition between two optimization vectors.

## Technical requirements
This project relies on the gurobi LP solver, and prototyping is done using Jupyter notebooks. Code that has passed review will be in .py files and imported into jupyter notebooks as needed.
